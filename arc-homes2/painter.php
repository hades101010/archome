							Painting can provide many opportunities. Many of our leaders started off their careers in our business as a painter. It opened up a world of possibilities. We currently have one of these possibilities in Perth.<br><br>

							Our Painters are responsible for the timely preparation and painting of nominated customer sites to a high quality as per the directions of the Supervisor or Foreperson. A Painter also supports the team to deliver projects safely within the budgeted parameters (hours, materials and quality) and always endeavours to ensure that the job is completed to the customerâ€™s satisfaction under the direction of the Supervisor or Foreperson.
