						<h2>SURVEYING</h2>
						<p class="text-justify">With surveying experience across the Perth West Australia, our surveyors and field personnel follow procedures carefully designed to avoid errors, increase precision, and ensure that data collected is available for use in designing projects and completing surveys. Survey crews are equipped with technologically relevant equipment to provide the best and most accurate survey of each project. Because of the high level of training of our surveyors and staff, each project is followed through from field to final product with the utmost care. Whatever the project requires our staff can get there and get it done on time and on budget. The collection of home data and other field operations move in a swift and well-focused manner, thanks to the skill and dedication of our experienced personnel.

						<h2>PAINTERS</h2>
						<p class="text-justify">Painting can provide many opportunities. Many of our leaders started off their careers in our business as a painter. It opened up a world of possibilities. We currently have one of these possibilities in Perth.<br><br>

							Our Painters are responsible for the timely preparation and painting of nominated customer sites to a high quality as per the directions of the Supervisor or Foreperson. A Painter also supports the team to deliver projects safely within the budgeted parameters (hours, materials and quality) and always endeavours to ensure that the job is completed to the customer’s satisfaction under the direction of the Supervisor or Foreperson.
